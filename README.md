# VU Knowledge Representation - EL Reasoner

ADD PARAGRAPH OF PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
- [Java 23](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

### Installing

This codebase was programmed using python 3.10.1. The requirements.txt file contains all the need packages to run the code succesfully. 

Download this code base by running the following line in your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/mklblm/KR-EL-Reasoner```

Install all required packages by running the following line in your terminal:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### Java Gateway

This project was creating using the [dl4python library](https://github.com/PKoopmann/dl-lib). The libary is created specifically for the Knowledge Representation course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, in order for students to work with OWL ontologies in python instead of Java. In order to use dl4python, a number of preparation steps are necessary:

1. Make sure recent versions of Python and Java are installed.
2. Make sure Py4J is installed. This library is included in the requirements.txt file, and should thus be installed if all previous installation steps were followed. Alternatively, type the following command in the terminal:

    ```pip install py4j```

3. In order to use the dl4python library and run the EL Reasoner, a gateway server between Python and Java needs to be running. Do so by typing the following command in the terminal:

    ```java -jar dl4python-0.1.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar```

4. This gateway should be opened in the same folder as the python files using the dl4python library you want to run. Keep the gateway running while you want to run the python files. 

5. Open a new terminal to run the python files.

## Running the Reasoner

The EL reasoner can be run by calling the following command in the terminal:

```python main.py ontology_file_path class_name```

1. ontology_file_path should contain the path to an OWL ontology file.
2. class_name should contain the name of a class in the ontology file for which you want to find the subsumers.

### Example

Below is an example command that can be used to find the subsumers of the "Margherita" class in the pizza.owl file.

```python main.py ontologies/pizza.owl '"Margherita"'```

The output of this command will look like this:

CheesyPizza

Margherita

PizzaComUmNome

DomainThing

Pizza

Food

‚ä§

The printed classes are the found subsumers for the Margherita class. This list can be compared to the pizza ontology file itself.

Other examples can be run by replacting "Margherita" with any other named class, e.g. "Cajun" or "Caprina".
